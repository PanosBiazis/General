//If you watch this file,you will realise that this code was made for EDUCATIONAL REASONS.
//C (pronounced /ˈsiː/ – like the letter c) is a general-purpose computer programming language.
// It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential.
// By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. 
//It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing.
//C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.
//Before you clicked this file,you saw  something defferent on the file.You saw the file ends with '.c'.
//That means it is written in C Programming Language and some files ends with '.h'.
//They are header files which contain function prototypes and functions.
// A preprocessor is a program which is executed before passing the source program to the compiler.
//(#) c uses hash to execute smalls fuction in preprocessor.
//The main function of Preprocessor is to include header files and define constants.
// #include is used to include a header file
//All header files is a collection of files which contains useful functions and macros to be used.
//All of that called library.   
#include <stdio.h> // is a header file which contains definitions of input/output operations.
#include <stdlib.h>// is another header file in c which contain memory managemet utilities and string conversion functions.
#include <string.h>//for strings fuctions
#include <math.h> //is a header file which contains mathematical function which can be directlynused to perform numerous operations.
#include <time.h> // contains functions to perform operations on time.
#include <conio.h>// contains functions to perform input and output operations.
#include <ctype.h>// contains functions to perform operations on characters.
#include <windows.h>// contains functions to perform operations on windows.
#include <stdbool.h>// contains functions to perform operations on boolean values.
#include <io.h>// contains functions to perform operations on files.
#include <limits.h>// contains functions to perform operations on integer values.
#include <signal.h>// contains functions to perform operations on signals.
#include <locale.h>// contains functions to perform operations on locales.
#include <errno.h>// contains functions to perform operations on error values.
//#define is used to define a macro, it makes the name reserved word be replaced with the value
//#define STATES 29 //this will replace all instances of "STATES" with 29 wherever it appears in this code
//you can define even whole strings for example, #define meme "program 2.0"
//#undef is used to undefine a macro,opposite of what  #define does
//If you understand what i'm doing,you can write your comments with this // or
/*like this way but it's used for multiline comments or in other words for multiple lines of comments
like this.*/
// #if and #else can be used to check if a condition is true even before the source is compiled 
// #ifdef is used to check if a macro is define.if the macro is defined it returns true
// #ifndef is used to check if a macro is not defined.if the macro isn't defined it returns true
//Enumeration (or enum) is a user defined data type in C. It is mainly used to assign names to integral constants, the names make a program easy to read and maintain.For example,
//enum year{null,Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul,Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec}; 
/* run this program using the console pauser or add your own getch, (system("pause");) or input loop */
int main()//main function is where program execution starts and ends.
{
//printf("Starting"); //this will print "Starting" on the screen
//or you can use puts() function instead of printf(),it automatically adds "\n" at the end of the string.
//puts("Starting"); //this will print "Starting" on the screen followed by a new line
//you can define a variable using int for integers for instance,
//int a; when 'a' is a number and if you write like this,it will get by default 0 value.
//If you want for decimal numbers,you can define a variable as float or double for even bigger numbers and decimals. E.g.
// float a; when 'a' is a float number and if you want write like this,it will get by default 0.0 value.
//double a; when 'a' is a double number and if you want write like this,it will get by default 0.00000... value.
//If you want to define and store a character,you can define a variable as char or string for even bigger characters and strings. E.g.
//char a; when 'a' is a character and if you want write like this,it will get by default 0 value.
//system("pause"); you can  use it to pause program execution without the (//)
