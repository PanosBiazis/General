% The code in family_script.pl from lines 3 to 10 is designed to perform a specific task related to handling family data. The purpose of this code is to define a set of variables that will likely be used later in the script to store information about family members.

% In terms of input, this section of the code does not take any user input directly. Instead, it initializes variables that may be used to hold data that could be provided later in the program. For example, these variables might eventually hold names, ages, or relationships of family members.

% The output of this code is not immediately visible because it is simply setting up variables. However, the values assigned to these variables will be used later in the script to produce meaningful output, such as displaying family information or performing calculations based on the data stored in these variables.

% The logic of this code is straightforward. It starts by declaring variables and assigning them initial values. This is a common practice in programming, as it prepares the program to work with specific data types and values. By defining these variables early on, the script ensures that it has a clear structure and that it knows what kind of data it will be dealing with as it runs.

% An important aspect of this code is the way it organizes data. By using variables, the script can easily manage and manipulate family-related information. For example, if the script needs to calculate the average age of family members or list their names, it can do so by referencing these variables. This organization helps keep the code clean and makes it easier to understand how data flows through the program.

% In summary, the code in family_script.pl from lines 3 to 10 sets up the groundwork for handling family data by defining variables. While it does not take input or produce output directly, it plays a crucial role in preparing the script to manage and manipulate family-related information effectively.
