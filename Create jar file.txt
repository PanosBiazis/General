Make sure that you have organise into two folders source for .java and classes,then open cmd as administrator.
write cd C:\Users\panag\Documents\tries
if your files are in different directory saved then write cd/
write d:
Furthermore, change the directory i  wrote after this step
write cd source
write javac -d ../classes *.java
write cd C:\Users\panag\Documents\tries
write cd C:\Users\panag\Documents\tries\classes\myJavaproject
make a txt file called manifest.txt
inside this file write "Main-Class: myfirst_class"
save the file and close it
go to cmd (Make sure you are on this directory "C:\Users\panag\Documents\tries\classes\myJavaproject") and write jar -cvmf manifest.txt myfirst_class.jar *.class
If you see on the directory, you can realise that  it has been created a file myfirst_class.jar and this your executable file.
