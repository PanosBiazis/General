' This is a simple Visual Basic .NET program that prints "Hello World!" to the console.

' Here's a breakdown:

' Imports System: This line imports the System namespace, which provides fundamental classes and types for the .NET framework.
' Module Program: This line declares a new module named Program. In VB.NET, a module is similar to a class, but it can't be instantiated and all its members are shared.
' Sub Main(args As String()): This line declares the Main subroutine, which is the entry point of the program. The args As String() parameter is an array of strings that represents the command-line arguments passed to the program.
' Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"): This line prints "Hello World!" to the console, followed by a newline character.
' End Sub and End Module: These lines mark the end of the Main subroutine and the Program module, respectively.
' This code is a typical "Hello, World!" example, often used to illustrate the basic structure of a program in a given programming language.
